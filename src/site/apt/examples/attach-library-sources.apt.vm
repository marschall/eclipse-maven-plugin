Attach Library Sources and Javadocs

  Artifacts with sources deployed can be attached to Eclipse libraries using
  <<<downloadSources>>>. Javadocs may be attached using <<<downloadJavadocs>>> The sources and javadocs of the libraries <must> exist in the
  repository so that the plugin can download it and attach it.

  The following example shows how to do this in the command-line:

+-----
mvn eclipse:eclipse -DdownloadSources=true  -DdownloadJavadocs=true
+-----

  or in your pom.xml:

+-----
<project>
  [...]
  <build>
    [...]
    <plugins>
      [...]
      <plugin>
        <groupId>org.apache.maven.plugins</groupId>
        <artifactId>maven-eclipse-plugin</artifactId>
        <version>${project.version}</version>
        <configuration>
          <downloadSources>true</downloadSources>
          <downloadJavadocs>true</downloadJavadocs>
        </configuration>
      </plugin>
      [...]
    </plugins>
    [...]
  </build>
  [...]
</project>
